# iLO 2.50 Patch
This patch is copied verbatim from iLO4 Toolbox. It does not provide any fan control functionality, but merely provides the base framework needed to patch firmware binaries with signature validation skips.

This patch isn't intended for use, nor has it been tested. It's merely provided as the baseline of work produced by Airbus Security Lab needed to continue this work.
