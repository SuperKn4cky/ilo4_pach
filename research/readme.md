# Research Notes

Please note: I took pretty hasty & quick notes while I worked. I've try to organize them more clearly for the benefit of future researchers.

A disclaimer: I'm not professionally trained in reverse engineering, assembly, or ARM code. I've explored all three areas, but not with great depth. I'm a student & run a homelab in my bedroom, creating my intrigue in working on this. I had many firsts along the way, dug myself into many holes, and wasted lots of time running in circles.
