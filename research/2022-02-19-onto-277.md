# 2022-02-19: Building v2.77

Building v2.77 was pretty easy ... at this point, I've written offsets for v2.73, v2.79, and v2.78. I was pretty used to it.

I booted up and had the same issues with stdout -- the iLO hung if I called any of my fan commands. I stripped out the stdout function calls, and was very happy to see the `fan` commands WORKING! All that remains is to patch stdout.

## Stdout fixes
I wasn't surprised to see the stdout patch was breaking. It was the part of the code I looked at the least. I dug around for a while trying to find why the references would be messed up and break the stdout code. Ultimately, the solution was obvious and I documented it in patches/277/patches.md.

I didn't take very good notes here, so I don't have much to share. However, with the stdout bugs patched ...

it works!


## Closing Thoughts
This ends my (maybe first/only, maybe just first) research sprint into this project. I'll be releasing v2.77 to the community.

Here's some stuff that needs additional work:
I'd love to patch the SSH bug where output is only shown on the first SSH shell. I'm pretty sure this is doable and depends on my research into the Connection Records previously done. Hopefully I can make something without too much work
And patching v2.78+ ... this is a monumentally large project and not really worth it to me. So we'll see.
