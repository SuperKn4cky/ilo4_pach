I work up a build system to transparently build iLO binaries & read a bunch of assembly.

Now that I had an identical file for v2.73, I knew I was in a good place to work on migrating v2.79. However, before I could, I needed to actually understand the implications of the code within v2.73, so I could adjust relative calls as necessary. I got distracted a lot here looking into random stuff, so pardon the mess. Here's some snippets from my findings:

_NB: most of the useful info here is also written in the patches/273/patches.md file!_

```
shell commands are stored in struct array -- see:

00000000 shell_cmd       struc ; (sizeof=0x1C, mappedto_3)
00000000                                         ; XREF: .ConAppCLI.elf.data:0220D5E4/r
00000000 addr1           DCD ?
00000004 addr2           DCD ?                   ; offset (00000000)
00000008 addr3           DCD ?                   ; offset (00000000)
0000000C addr4           DCD ?                   ; offset (00000000)

0000001C shell_cmd       ends
0000001C
54 shell commands defined
order appears to match strings in string list

a case study for 'help' command:
help is #7 (indx 6)
4C FA 09 00 - addr1 (0009FA4C)
28 8B 01 00 - entry (00018B28)
A4 3F 01 00 - addr3 (00013FA4)
A4 50 01 00 - addr4 (000150A4)

entrypoint is @
.ConAppCLI.elf.text:0216EB28 (CLI_helpHandler)
.ConAppCLI.elf.text begins @ 02166000
virtual memory begins at 0x00010000 so
entry @ 0x18B28 - 0x10000 + 0x02166000 = 0x216EB28 = CLI_helpHandler

addr1 = points to name string
addr2 = points to entrypoint fn
addr3 = points to `version help` function
addr4 = points to `help help` function
```
This is the shell command data stored in .ConAppCLI.elf.data - basically a big array of commands that each have a pointer to their name, entrypoint, help, and version data. This makes sense, since our patch that shifts the entrypoint changes these bytes 4x, once for each function call. Specifically, as one might imagine, it shifts `addr2` which is the entrypoint. Once I figured out how the pointers worked in virtual memory (they're relative to the running memory, which would make sense & is a lot easier to view in the dissected view of the task from ilo4_toolbox!) it was pretty easy to figure out how we're adjusting them to point to our new entrypoints.

```
.health call traced back; uses jumptable w/ 5/6/7/8 value to call fan
```
In our entrypoints, we had some magic numbers 5/6/7/8 that was used to setup the fan/ocsd/health/ocbb calls. Turns out that .health has a big jump table / switch statement and these correspond (I guess probably to an enum) to call different functions. No surprises here, but I dug it up because I was curious what the magic numbers came from. (afterthought: this was also important to verifying the jumptable didn't change order etc between versions)

I did some additional digging into random stuff to figure out how arguments were being passed. I didn't really make too much progress, but I learned a good amount about the codebase:
```
let's trace another function:
oemhp_ping takes in a single arg:
"oemhp_ping 127.0.0.1"
and reports a success string
(it also can be used more complexly:
oemhp_ping [-s size] [-c count] [-i interval] address

the string is defined in text at 021F5AC4
giving a relative offset of:
0x21F5AC4 - 0x2166000 + 0x10000 = 0x9FAC4 (C4 FA 09 00)
this reveals the command to exist @ .ConAppCLI.elf.data:0220D868
and its entrypoint is
80 A0 01 00 -> 0x01A080 + 0x2166000 - 0x10000 = 0x2170080

(at this point i remembered we can also use the CLI_...handler convention to find the function call)

.ConAppCLI.elf.text:02170080
allocates less space on the stack (#0x100)
Runs 78 01 1F E5

at this point, let me install the arm toolchain quickly to help me debug some of these lines
https://web1.foxhollow.ca/?menu=centos7arm

here's a usecase:
echo "0: 25 10 d5 e5" | xxd -r > a.bin && arm-none-eabi-objdump -D -m arm -b binary a.bin
->    0:	e5d51025 	ldrb	r1, [r5, #37]	; 0x25

Runs
0:	e51f0178 	ldr	r0, [pc, #-376]
anyway:
allocates 0x100 on stack
saves R0 (R5) and calls sub_2177F9C
saves result (R6), calls sub_2198D74 w/ R1 string (some kind of logging?)
loads 0x1570 to R0
looks like a null pointer test

R6 is the return value from sub_2177F9C
(not really sure what this is .... given the offset, probably some kind of
object? maybe a context-preserving obj)
R1 = R6+0x1570
R0 = SP
R0 = initial R0
R1 = "/map1" string - base address... like a regkey?
(can show/set/etc)
calls sub_2173B98 (change targets) -- this would
be the equivalent to `cd /map1`

R0 = R5 (initial R0)

call sub_216DB3C ( "Ping Target")

grabs context w/ context_grab
accesses CTX+0x1780 -> +0x28 = R1
nested structure

0x1780 contains a pointer to unk_struct
unk_struct has a value at 0x28

if R1 is nonzero
	calls value at R1 ...
else
	stores 2 @ CTX+0x28
	stores 0xA @ CTX+0x60
	stores 0xB @ CTX+0x98
	stores 0xB @ CTX+0x04
calls display_stats, which populates based on CTX ... makes sense
```

The train of thought here is pretty scattered. I'm tracing through a random CLI method line-by-line trying to figure out how it initializes and parses arguments. The most interesting thing I found here is that there's an object that has specific commands attached to our `context` (more on that below). Here's a rough writeup:
```
CTX {
...
	0x1780 cmdRef {
		0x0 cmd ptr (#0) (used by ShowTarget)
		0x28 cmd ptr (#40) (used by PingTarget)
		0x30 cmd ptr () (used by DeleteSSHKeyTarget)
		0x34 cmd ptr () (used by ResetHotkeysTarget)
		0x2C cmd ptr (#44) (used by loadSSHKeyTarget)
		0xnn undefinedcmd = 0
	}
}
```

but context??:
CLI commands open with a call to something that I call 'context_grab'. It passes in R0 and gets a struct back with some data. I figured out that the structure for that looks like this:
```
context_grab(data) {
	some_table = [];
	index_of(data) {
		for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
			if(some_table[i][4] == data)
				return i;
		}
		return 6;
	}
	var indx = index_of(data);
	if(indx > 6) return 0;
	return some_table[indx]
}
```
Essentially, it just loops through the struct and finds a value based on some unique `data` value. This is R0 within the function calls. The 'some_table' struct is my next search. It seems to be allocated a pointer within the .data section, but its just zero'd out. Realistically, it should be in .bss since its an uninitialized global. Not sure what happened there. Anyway, its an array that gets allocated at runtime so not much to dissect. I used some of the construction code to get a rough outline:
```
ConnectionRecords[] = [
	Record Ptr {
		0x0: value of UNK+0x108
		0x4: ??? some kind of unique identifier? (used by context_grab)
		0x8: PostSemaphore
		0xC: ReadSemaphore
		0x14: 0
		0x18:
		0x24: 0
		0x1C: 0
		0x28: 0
		0x60: 0
		0x98: 0
		0x264: ?
		0x1164: (init)
		0x126C: (init)
		0x1570: ?
	}
]
```
This ConnectionRecord seems to have a fixed max length of 6. I noticed that after 5 SSH clients, I can't connect to the server anymore. So these connectionrecords get allocated individually for SSH clients (either I have an off-by-one error in my reading, or there's another permanently open ConnectionRecord that might correspond to the iLO's serial shell).

So, the start of each CLI function:
has some R0, uses context_grab to get the pointer to the ConnectionRecord for the relevant connection.
They use the ConnectionRecord for a few things - some stuff that looks suspiciously like string args!
```
calls dword_38D8F54 (libintegrity) w/ (SP, 0x200)
access connectionRecord[0x1570] & pass it to R1
sub_39088D4(SP+0x900, connectionRecord[0x1570]) // this ends up being SP-0x100 based on entry since we shift SP
this is some libc call - it checks == 3 and performs operations ...

sub_3908800(connectionRecord[0x264]) -> strlen
if(length = 0) -> prints full help

sub_3908800(connectionRecord[0x364]) -> strlen
if(length = 0) -> jumps down
calls dword_38D8F54(SP+800, 0x40)
```
Could connectionRecord contain the last inputted string, already spaced out? i.e.
first argument @ [0x264], second argument @ [0x364]?

Certainly possible, but it wasn't used in phoenixdev's code so I tried my best to ignore it. Their code relies on some magic offset from r7, but I have no idea where r7 came from since its not initialized within the function. It would break caller convention to have input data in r7 when the function is called, though that might not matter here since our CLI functions are really an 'inner' / anonymous function of sorts. It'd be worthwhile to find the triggerer that actually calls the function from the lookup table. But I haven't found / looked too hard yet. It might define r7 to be something that makes this make more sense.
