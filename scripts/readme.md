# Scripts

Just as a base reference to how to use some of this work, I've uploaded my fan control boot scripts here. **I do not suggest them to be used** but they provide good context for how you can automate controlling the fans.

If you have a good script that you found useful utilizing the patched firmware, please let me know / make a PR and I'd love to include it.
